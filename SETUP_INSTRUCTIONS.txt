EARTHQUAKE PREDICTION PROJECT - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
==============================================

This project requires several Python packages to run all features.
Install them with the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If you encounter any issues, you can install packages individually:

pip install pandas numpy requests tqdm
pip install geopandas shapely pyproj  # For geospatial analysis
pip install skyfield  # For lunar position calculations
pip install matplotlib seaborn plotly  # For visualization

The script will work with limited functionality even without all packages.
